# Codingame Puzzle Solutions

This repository is a collection of my solutions for various puzzles on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com). These solutions are a part of my ongoing efforts to study and improve my skills in multiple programming languages. The repository is structured to reflect the organization of challenges on CodinGame and is sorted by the difficulty level and language of the solution.

## Repository Structure

Each directory within the repository is named after the difficulty level of the puzzles as categorized on CodinGame. Within these directories, the solutions are further organized by programming language.

For example:
```
classic-puzzle-easy
├── bash
├── csharp
├── go
├── python
└── rust
```

Within each language directory, you'll find files named after the puzzles with appropriate language extensions.

For example:

- `classic-puzzle-easy/csharp/7-segment-scanner.cs`
- `classic-puzzle-easy/rust/logic-gates.rs`

## Languages

The solutions in this repository are provided in the following programming languages:

- Bash
- C# (CSharp)
- Go (Golang)
- Python
- Rust

## Puzzles

The puzzles are categorized by CodinGame's difficulty rating:

- Classic Puzzle - Easy
- Classic Puzzle - Medium (coming soon)
- Classic Puzzle - Hard (coming soon)
- Classic Puzzle - Very Hard (coming soon)

## Usage

Each solution file can be run in an environment that supports the respective programming language. Ensure you have the necessary compilers or interpreters installed on your machine:

- Bash: Unix-like shell or Git Bash on Windows.
- C#: .NET SDK to compile and run.
- Go: Go language environment.
- Python: Python interpreter.
- Rust: Rust toolchain with Cargo.

## Contribution

While this repository serves primarily as a personal codebase for my study, contributions or suggestions are welcome. If you find an issue or have a more efficient solution, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

Please note that each puzzle solution has been crafted for educational purposes and reflects my understanding of the problem at the time of writing.
